You said:
I want option A can you tell me number of agent required according to you 
ChatGPT said:
Great — you've chosen Option A: Customer Support Ticket Analyzer.

✅ Required: Minimum 2 Agents
But to stand out and handle complexity well, I recommend:

🔧 Suggested Agent Architecture (3–4 Agents)
To show true specialization and coordination, here’s a design that balances clarity and depth:

🧠 Agent 1: Ticket Intent Classifier
Purpose: Analyze the subject and message to determine the ticket type:

Bug / Outage / Complaint

Feature Request

Billing / Subscription

UI/UX Issue

Security Concern

Output: intent: str

🧪 Agent 2: Customer Priority Evaluator
Purpose: Score customer priority based on:

customer_tier (Free < Premium < Enterprise)

monthly_revenue

account_age_days

previous_tickets

Output: priority_score: float (0–1), priority_level: low / medium / high / urgent

🧭 Agent 3: Routing Advisor
Purpose: Make the routing decision based on:

Output of Agent 1 (intent)

Output of Agent 2 (priority)

Examples:

UI bug + low priority → Self-help article

Security concern + high priority → Escalate to Security Team

Complaint + high priority → Senior Customer Success Rep

Output: routed_to: str, rationale: str

(Optional) 🛡️ Agent 4: Sanity Checker / Conflict Resolver
Purpose: Check all previous agent decisions.

Detect conflicts or unreasonable decisions (e.g., low priority for an enterprise security issue).

Adjust outputs or flag for human review.

Summary
Agent	Role	Output Used By
Ticket Intent Classifier	Understands what the ticket is about	Routing Advisor
Customer Priority Evaluator	Quantifies user impact/urgency	Routing Advisor
Routing Advisor	Makes final decision	Final Output
(Optional) Sanity Checker	Ensures logical consistency	Human QA or adjustment
✅ Benefits of This Design:
Clear separation of concerns

Shows true multi-agent coordination

Handles edge cases and conflicting signals

Gives you more material for your documentation and evaluation metrics

Would you like me to:

Generate the base agents/ folder with all 3 or 4 agents?

Help you define the JSON schemas for inputs/outputs using Pydantic?

Set up a test runner for the 5 test tickets?

Let me know how you'd like to proceed.

You said:
Ok 
ChatGPT said:
I've created the initial structure for your multi-agent system and added the first agent: TicketIntentClassifier.

🧱 What's Included:
agents/ticket_intent_classifier.py:

Defines TicketIntentInput and TicketIntentOutput using Pydantic.

A placeholder function classify_ticket_intent() that maps keywords to intents like bug_report, feature_request, security_concern, etc.

✅ Next Steps:
Would you like me to:

Add the next agent: CustomerPriorityEvaluator?

Implement the RoutingAdvisor?

Set up main.py to orchestrate agent calls?

Create the evaluation/ framework for test ticket validation?

Let me know how you'd like to build this up — step-by-step or full draft.

You said:

ChatGPT said:
The error you're encountering:

KeyError: 'urgency'
is happening because this line in your main.py:

ticket['urgency']
is trying to access a key that does not exist in the original ticket dictionary.

✅ Root Cause:
You're passing ticket['urgency'] to the PriorityAgent.evaluate() function:

prio = prio_agent.evaluate(
    ticket["customer_tier"],
    ticket["previous_tickets"],
    ticket["monthly_revenue"],
    ticket["account_age_days"],
    ticket['urgency']  # ❌ This key doesn't exist
)
But none of your ticket entries (e.g., SUP-001 to SUP-005) contain the key "urgency" — that's something your MessageAnalysisAgent is supposed to derive.

✅ Fix:
You likely meant to use the urgency predicted by msg_agent, like this:

msg = msg_agent.analyze(ticket["subject"], ticket["message"])

prio = prio_agent.evaluate(
    ticket["customer_tier"],
    ticket["previous_tickets"],
    ticket["monthly_revenue"],
    ticket["account_age_days"],
    msg["urgency"]  # ✅ Use output from msg_agent
)
🔁 Summary of Fixes:
Update this part of your loop:

msg = msg_agent.analyze(ticket["subject"], ticket["message"])

# ✅ FIXED: Pass urgency from msg_agent's output
prio = prio_agent.evaluate(
    ticket["customer_tier"],
    ticket["previous_tickets"],
    ticket["monthly_revenue"],
    ticket["account_age_days"],
    msg["urgency"]
)
That should fix the KeyError ✅

Let me know if you'd like me to help review the logic in MessageAnalysisAgent or PriorityAgent next.

You said:
I want to know about evaluation 
ChatGPT said:
Great — let's cover evaluation for your multi-agent system on the Customer Support Ticket Analyzer.

🧪 Goal of Evaluation
The evaluation framework should help you measure how well your system performs across various tickets, especially in:

Ticket understanding (intent, tone, urgency)

Priority scoring

Routing accuracy & rationality

✅ Recommended Evaluation Setup
1. Test Cases (Already Provided)
You're working with 5 diverse support tickets (SUP-001 to SUP-005). These cover:

Free vs. enterprise customers

Complaints, bugs, feature requests, security issues, etc.

You should run all 5 through your full pipeline.

2. Evaluation Metrics (At least 3 required)
Here are 4 strong metric candidates:

Metric	Purpose	How to Compute
Intent Accuracy	Measures if issue_type matches expected intent	Use expected_issue_type labels for test cases
Routing Correctness	Measures if ticket was routed to the right team	Compare route_to to expected value
Urgency Consistency	Checks if high urgency tone maps to high priority	Flag mismatches between urgency and priority_level
Agent Agreement (optional)	Checks for conflicting agent conclusions	E.g., urgency = high, but priority = low
You can define a manual ground truth JSON file:

{
  "SUP-001": {
    "expected_issue_type": "bug_report",
    "expected_route_to": "Customer Support",
    "expected_priority_level": "low"
  },
  ...
}
3. Evaluation Code Structure
Inside evaluation/evaluator.py:

def evaluate_results(system_outputs: list, ground_truth: dict):
    correct_routing = 0
    correct_intent = 0
    total = len(system_outputs)

    for result in system_outputs:
        tid = result["ticket_id"]
        gt = ground_truth[tid]

        if result["route_to"] == gt["expected_route_to"]:
            correct_routing += 1
        if result["issue_type"] == gt["expected_issue_type"]:
            correct_intent += 1

        # Optionally: Add checks for urgency/priority mismatch

    print("Routing Accuracy:", correct_routing / total)
    print("Intent Classification Accuracy:", correct_intent / total)
4. Document Evaluation
In docs/architecture.md or README.md, mention:

Metrics used (why and how)

Any misclassified test cases

Trends or insights (e.g., “short messages confuse the intent agent”)

📂 Suggested File Layout for Evaluation
evaluation/
├── evaluator.py            # logic for comparing outputs
└── ground_truth.json       # expected intents, routes, etc.
Would you like me to:

Generate a template for evaluator.py?

Provide ground_truth.json for the 5 sample tickets?

Let me know how much you'd like scaffolded.

You said:
I got error recheck it
ChatGPT said:
I've updated the logic in your TicketIntentClassifier to catch more phrases like "can't" and "dashboard" for better intent classification. Now, let me address your request about the evaluation setup with a fully working template.

✅ Complete Evaluation Template
Here's a functional version of evaluation/evaluator.py with error-free logic and clear metrics:

# evaluation/evaluator.py

import json

def evaluate_results(system_outputs_path, ground_truth_path):
    with open(system_outputs_path, "r") as f:
        system_outputs = json.load(f)

    with open(ground_truth_path, "r") as f:
        ground_truth = json.load(f)

    correct_routing = 0
    correct_intent = 0
    correct_priority = 0
    total = len(system_outputs)

    for result in system_outputs:
        tid = result["ticket_id"]
        gt = ground_truth.get(tid, {})

        if not gt:
            print(f"⚠️ Warning: No ground truth for {tid}")
            continue

        if result["route_to"] == gt["expected_route_to"]:
            correct_routing += 1
        if result["issue_type"] == gt["expected_issue_type"]:
            correct_intent += 1
        if result["priority_level"] == gt["expected_priority_level"]:
            correct_priority += 1

    print("\n=== Evaluation Summary ===")
    print("Routing Accuracy: {:.2f}".format(correct_routing / total))
    print("Intent Accuracy: {:.2f}".format(correct_intent / total))
    print("Priority Accuracy: {:.2f}".format(correct_priority / total))
📘 Sample ground_truth.json
{
  "SUP-001": {
    "expected_issue_type": "bug_report",
    "expected_route_to": "Customer Support",
    "expected_priority_level": "low"
  },
  "SUP-002": {
    "expected_issue_type": "ui_issue",
    "expected_route_to": "Product Team",
    "expected_priority_level": "medium"
  },
  "SUP-003": {
    "expected_issue_type": "feature_request",
    "expected_route_to": "Product Team",
    "expected_priority_level": "medium"
  },
  "SUP-004": {
    "expected_issue_type": "bug_report",
    "expected_route_to": "Engineering",
    "expected_priority_level": "medium"
  },
  "SUP-005": {
    "expected_issue_type": "security_concern",
    "expected_route_to": "Security Team",
    "expected_priority_level": "urgent"
  }
}
📌 Usage
Run from root directory:

python evaluation/evaluator.py
Make sure:

Your system writes results.json correctly.

Paths to system_outputs_path and ground_truth_path are accurate.

Let me know if you want this saved into your project files directly. I can also generate example visualizations (like confusion matrices or bar charts) if you’re including this in your docs.

You said:
I had use I'm my agent llm for task performing decision taking 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect — using LLMs as decision-making agents in your multi-agent setup is a strong move and aligns exactly with what Draconic is evaluating you on:

"…your ability to design truly specialized agents (not just one agent with different prompts)."

🧠 So what does this mean for evaluation?
When you use LLMs to generate outputs (e.g., issue_type, urgency, priority_level, route_to), your evaluation should focus on behavioral consistency and correctness, not just static logic.

Here’s how you can frame your evaluation for LLM-based agents:

✅ Evaluation Framework for LLM Agents
📍 1. Ground Truth Comparison (Quantitative)
Even if your agents are dynamic, you can still compare outputs against expected values in ground_truth.json, as shown earlier.

Use this for:

Routing accuracy

Issue type classification accuracy

Priority level alignment with urgency/tier

📍 2. Inter-Agent Consistency (Qualitative + Heuristic)
Use logical rules to check if your LLMs are reasoning consistently:

if urgency == "high" and priority_level in ["low"]:
    flag("Inconsistent urgency/priority for " + ticket_id)
These aren't hard metrics, but logical tests that highlight errors in coordination.

📍 3. Confidence & Variability
If your LLM returns confidence scores (e.g., from prompt design or classification logits), evaluate:

Variance across runs (stability)

Threshold-based cutoffs for flagging low-confidence outputs

📍 4. Failure Logging
Log any unusual, ambiguous, or wrong predictions in a separate file like failures.json:

{
  "SUP-001": "Incorrectly classified as feature_request instead of bug_report",
  "SUP-003": "Routed to Support instead of Product Team"
}
📊 Final Report Suggestions (for README.md or docs/architecture.md)
In your documentation, include:

Section	Content
LLM Behavior Summary	Describe how each LLM-based agent was prompted (show 1–2 prompt examples)
Evaluation Metrics Used	Accuracy (routing, intent), consistency checks, LLM confidence thresholds
Interesting Behaviors	e.g., “LLM downgraded urgency due to polite tone even though issue was critical”
Failures & Fixes	List 5–10 failure cases and what you learned or adjusted
✅ Example Prompt Iteration Log
For the deliverable ai_chat_history.txt, you can include:

Prompt v1 (MessageAnalysisAgent):
"Classify the following ticket message for urgency and tone..."

Returned "low urgency" for security ticket → incorrect

Prompt v2:
Added: 'Security issues are always high urgency' → now works
Would you like help:

Designing robust prompts for each LLM agent?

Auto-generating these consistency checks?

Formatting your evaluation log as a readable markdown table?

Just say the word.

You said:
I think I had debug there is some error related to api keys so have fix it 
ChatGPT said:
Great catch — if your agents are calling LLM APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Pydantic AI, etc.), then API key issues are very common culprits for system errors.

✅ Common API Key Issues & Fixes
Here's a quick checklist to make sure everything runs smoothly:

🔐 1. Missing or Invalid API Key
Error:

openai.error.AuthenticationError: No API key provided.
Fix:
Make sure you're loading the key securely, e.g.:

import os
import openai

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
And that you have it set in your environment:

For local:

export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
Or in .env:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
Use python-dotenv if needed:

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
⚠️ 2. Wrong Scope or Model Access
If using OpenAI models like gpt-4, make sure:

You’re in the correct org or workspace

You’ve been granted access to the model

🧼 3. Rate Limit or Quota Errors
Symptoms:

Some API calls work, others fail

System stalls at specific tickets

Fix:
Add retry logic with backoff:

import time

for i in range(3):
    try:
        return openai.ChatCompletion.create(...)
    except openai.error.RateLimitError:
        time.sleep(2 ** i)
🧪 4. Agent-Specific Key Setup
If you’re using tools like Pydantic AI, LangChain, or LlamaIndex, check if each agent is properly initialized with credentials.

For example:

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4", openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
✅ Suggested File Structure
Include a .env file (excluded from Git):

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
And ensure .gitignore contains:

.env
Want Help Verifying?
I can check your agent files (message_analysis_agent.py, priority_agent.py, etc.) for proper key usage and secure initialization. Feel free to share snippets or errors.

Once that’s fixed, your full pipeline should execute cleanly. Let me know how it goes!

# 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture: Customer Support Ticket Analyzer

## 🎯 Overview
This system uses a multi-agent architecture built with Pydantic AI to analyze customer support tickets and route them intelligently. Each agent is designed to handle a specific sub-task using an LLM, allowing specialization and inter-agent coordination.

---

## 🧩 Agents and Responsibilities

### 1. **MessageAnalysisAgent**
- **Purpose**: Analyzes the subject and message of the support ticket.
- **Outputs**:
  - `issue_type`: one of {bug_report, complaint, feature_request, ui_issue, security_concern, other}
  - `tone`: sentiment or emotional tone of the message
  - `urgency`: classified as {low, medium, high}

### 2. **PriorityAgent**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the customer's importance and overall priority level of the ticket.
- **Inputs**: customer tier, account age, monthly revenue, previous tickets, and urgency
- **Output**:
  - `priority_level`: {low, medium, high, urgent}

### 3. **RoutingAgent**
- **Purpose**: Decides the appropriate internal routing of the ticket.
- **Inputs**: issue type, urgency, tone, and priority level
- **Output**:
  - `route_to`: target team or support level (e.g., Support, Product, Engineering, Security)

---

## 🔁 Agent Interaction Flow

Ticket Input
↓
[MessageAnalysisAgent]
↓
[Tone, Urgency, IssueType] ┐
├→ [RoutingAgent] → route_to
[PriorityAgent] ← Urgency ┘

Always show details


---

## 🧪 Evaluation Strategy

### Metrics Used
- **Intent Accuracy**: Correct classification of issue type
- **Routing Accuracy**: Whether the ticket was routed to the correct team
- **Priority Consistency**: Logical alignment between urgency and priority level

### Test Cases
- All 5 provided tickets (SUP-001 to SUP-005) are evaluated using `evaluation/evaluator.py`
- Manual ground truth labels are provided for validation

---

## 🛠️ Design Choices

- **Why Multiple Agents?**
  - Modular design simplifies prompt specialization
  - Easier testing and debugging of specific tasks
  - Encourages reuse in future systems

- **Why LLMs?**
  - Handle ambiguity, nuanced language, and customer tone
  - Adaptable across domains with prompt tuning

- **Failure Handling**
  - Edge cases (e.g. polite security concerns) are logged
  - Prompts iterated based on misclassifications in `ai_chat_history.txt`

---

## 🔍 Future Enhancements
- Add confidence scoring to each agent’s output
- Introduce a SanityCheckAgent for logical validation
- Improve few-shot examples in prompts for better LLM reasoning

This project is a multi-agent system built to analyze customer support tickets and determine the best routing strategy based on ticket content and customer profile. It was developed as part of the Draconic AI Engineering Case Study.

---

## 🚀 Objective

Create a multi-agent system using LLM-based agents that:

- Understand the **intent, urgency, and tone** of support tickets
- Assess **customer priority** using business metrics
- Recommend **routing decisions** to internal teams

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Agents Used

| Agent Name            | Responsibility                                                 |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MessageAnalysisAgent` | Extracts `issue_type`, `urgency`, and `tone` from ticket text |
| `PriorityAgent`        | Calculates ticket priority using customer tier, history, etc. |
| `RoutingAgent`         | Recommends routing path based on analysis + priority          |
| `SanityChecker`        | (Optional) Validates logical consistency in agent outputs     |

Agents are implemented using LLMs and Pydantic schema validation.

🧪 Evaluation
We used the following metrics:

Intent Accuracy: Did the model predict the right issue type?

Routing Accuracy: Did the ticket get routed to the right team?

Priority Consistency: Was urgency aligned with the final priority level?

Run the evaluation:

Always show details

python evaluation/evaluator.py
📈 Key Learnings
LLMs are excellent at abstracting tone and intent even from short, emotional tickets

Priority should consider both customer metrics and message urgency

Prompt engineering and consistency checking dramatically improve reliability

📽️ (Optional) Video Walkthrough
A 3–5 minute demo video may be included showing how the system works, explaining its architecture, and walking through one or two test cases.

✅ How to Run

Ok now I think the last task is chat_history.txt can you please tell me what is this , this is related to against conversation chat history or this ChatGPT chat history 
ChatGPT said:
Excellent question — and yes, it's crucial for your submission.

🗂️ What is ai_chat_history.txt?
This file should contain your ChatGPT (or AI assistant) conversation history while you developed the project. It's meant to demonstrate:

How you used AI tools to ideate, debug, or iterate

Prompt evolution, errors, fixes, and final decisions

Your thought process and refinement over time

✅ It must be your ChatGPT development history, not simulated chat between agents or user tickets.
🧠 Why Does Draconic Ask for This?
They explicitly state:

"AI Chat Export: Full conversation history showing your development process (as ai_chat_history.txt)"

It helps them:

See how you iterated and refined your prompts

Understand how you handled confusion, debugging, or reasoning

Judge how well you leveraged LLMs as a co-pilot

✍️ What Should Be In It?
Include your actual interactions from this project, such as:

Your early questions (e.g., “how many agents should I build?”)

Code generation by ChatGPT

Fixes for evaluation logic

Help with architecture, README, and so on

📥 How to Create It
Option 1: Use This Thread
You can simply:

Copy all of this conversation from ChatGPT

Paste it into a file named: ai_chat_history.txt

Add a few comments like:

# Start of AI Development Log
